## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Ambitious students join Kupintar to find or create study rooms, collaborate in real-time with peers, track their learning progress, and earn recognition for their engagement and achievements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user, **When** they sign up and join a public study room, **Then** they can participate in chat and view room details.
2. **Given** a user with friends, **When** they initiate a direct message, **Then** the conversation appears in their sidebar and is accessible for future reference.
3. **Given** a user with a streak, **When** they log in daily, **Then** their streak and XP are updated and visible on their dashboard.
4. **Given** a user with a Pro subscription, **When** they access advanced analytics, **Then** they see detailed study statistics and exclusive features.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to join a private room without an invite?  
- How does the system handle a user exceeding the free DM limit?  
- What if a user attempts to upload an unsupported avatar file type?  
- How are streaks handled if a user misses a day due to technical issues? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a grace period or appeal process?]
