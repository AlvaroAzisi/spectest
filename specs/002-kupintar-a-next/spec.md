## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Ambitious students join Kupintar to find or create study rooms, collaborate in real-time with peers, track their learning progress, and earn recognition for their engagement and achievements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user, **When** they sign up and join a public study room, **Then** they can participate in chat and view room details.
2. **Given** a user with friends, **When** they initiate a direct message, **Then** the conversation appears in their sidebar and is accessible for future reference.
3. **Given** a user with a streak, **When** they log in daily, **Then** their streak and XP are updated and visible on their dashboard.
4. **Given** a user with a Pro subscription, **When** they access advanced analytics, **Then** they see detailed study statistics and exclusive features.

5. **Given** a free user, **When** they attempt to access Pro-only features, **Then** they are prompted to upgrade and access is denied.
6. **Given** a user, **When** they upgrade to Pro, **Then** their subscription is activated and Pro features are unlocked.
7. **Given** a Pro user, **When** their subscription expires, **Then** access to Pro features is revoked and they are notified.
8. **Given** a Pro user, **When** they downgrade to free, **Then** Pro features become inaccessible and their status is updated.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to join a private room without an invite?  
- How does the system handle a user exceeding the free DM limit?  
- What if a user attempts to upload an unsupported avatar file type?  
- How are streaks handled if a user misses a day due to technical issues? If the user has a “Freeze Streak” token (earned via daily login rewards), their streak is protected for one missed day. Users can stack up to 2 tokens. If no token is available, the streak resets to zero.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create and join study rooms (public or private).
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide real-time chat within study rooms and for direct messages.
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable users to add friends and form friend groups.
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce DM limits for free users and unlock unlimited DMs for Pro users.
- **FR-005**: System MUST track and display XP, streaks, and achievements for each user.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a dashboard for users to view their progress and analytics.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to manage their profile, including avatar upload and personal info.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support room discovery and friend discovery features.
- **FR-009**: System MUST award badges for specific milestones and contributions.

**FR-013**: System MUST support email/password (with verification) and Google sign-in, extensible to future providers (Apple, GitHub, etc).
**FR-014**: System MUST allow jpg/png/webp up to 2MB, resize to 256x256, stored in Supabase public bucket with RLS owner-only access.
**FR-015**: System MUST allow users to leave or delete rooms they created.
## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

- Q4 2025: Join via code, DM & Group Chat, Badge System
- H1 2026: Whiteboard, Scheduling, Friend Auto-Matching
- 2026+: Video/Audio Calls (Pro)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

+
**users**: All registered accounts (unique id, email, etc)
**profiles**: User profile info (name, avatar, XP, streaks, badges, subscription)
**rooms**: Study rooms (title, description, tags, creator, access type, members)
**room_members**: Links users to rooms, tracks roles and permissions
**messages**: Chat messages in rooms or DMs (sender, timestamp, content)
**friends**: Social connections (status: pending, accepted)
**subscriptions**: Pro tier status, payment info, access rights
## Data Retention & Privacy
- **Messages**: Retained for 1 year, then archived or purged.
- **Room data**: Persist until deleted by admin.
- **User activity logs**: Retained for 6 months, then anonymized for analytics.
- **User controls**: Users can delete their own messages, leave rooms, and request account deletion (removes profile, anonymizes data).

## Error Handling & User Feedback
System provides clear, contextual error messages for common scenarios:
- Joining private/full room
- Unsupported/corrupt avatar upload
- Exceeding DM limits
- Invalid invite code
Messages explain what went wrong and how to fix it.

## Performance & Scale
- **Chat latency**: Target <200ms average message delivery
- **Room size**: 30 (Free) / 100 (Pro) for MVP; scale to 200+ after 10k users
- **Scalability**: Supabase real-time backend, scalable/shardable as needed

## Security & Compliance
- **Privacy compliance**: GDPR-like (right to be forgotten, data export)
- **Age**: Platform for 13+ (SMP and above); if <13, parental consent required
- **Security**: SSL/TLS enforced, passwords hashed (bcrypt or equivalent), RLS for all Supabase tables
- **Abuse prevention**: Rate-limiting and abuse prevention for chat/friend requests
